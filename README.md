# GxE-T2D-PANC
This repository contains all the code written for my final year project at Imperial College London, Department of Bioengineering. 
The aim of the project was to perform a set of GxE studies to assess the effect of type II diabetes on pancreatic cancer risk, using participant data from the UK Biobank.

Type II diabetes (T2D) has long been known to be associated with pancreatic cancer (PANC). However, the question still remains as to whehter their relationship is causual or consequencial. A cellular case of "the chicken or the egg", research has been inconclusive in unconvering whether T2D is a risk-factor of PANC, or whether it is the cancer itself which causes the onset of T2D. The aim of this project was to further investigate the relationship between T2D and PANC, in hope of better understanding their associaiton and potential interaction.
