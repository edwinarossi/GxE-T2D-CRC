# GxE-T2D-PANC
This repository contains all the code written for my final year project at Imperial College London, Department of Bioengineering. 
The aim of the project was to perform a set of GxE studies to assess the effect of T2D phenotypes on pancreatic cancer risk, using participant data from the UK Biobank.
